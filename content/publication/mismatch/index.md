abstract: "Magnetically actuated Janus surface microrollers show promise for biomedical applications, such as cargo delivery in blood flow. Theories about their locomotion are based on models of a 'rotating sphere on a nearby wall.' However, significant mismatches have been found between computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and experimental results for microrollers of different sizes. This study highlights an unaccounted-for force in the direction of lift, particularly for smaller microrollers, which is not included in CFD simulations. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for improving practical applications in biomedical engineering."

summary: "Magnetically actuated surface microrollers exhibit promise for biomedical delivery, but CFD simulations reveal mismatches in force balance, particularly for small microrollers."

Magnetically actuated Janus surface microrollers are a promising microrobotic platform with numerous potential applications in biomedical engineering, including targeted cargo delivery and navigation within physiological blood flow. Locomotion models for these microrollers are based on theories of a rotating sphere near a wall, but experimental results often differ significantly from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. 

In this study, the locomotion efficiency of microrollers with diameters of 5, 10, 25, and 50 Âµm was investigated. Experimental analyses revealed discrepancies in the lift force balance that CFD simulations failed to capture, particularly for smaller microrollers. Specifically, a previously unaccounted-for force was found in the lift direction, which plays a significant role in microroller dynamics. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of surface microroller behavior, which is crucial for their practical implementation in biomedical applications, such as drug delivery and lab-on-a-chip systems.
